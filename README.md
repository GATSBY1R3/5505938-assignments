1. The "Birthday Speeding Policy" code implements a function to determine the type of speeding ticket based on the driving speed and whether it is the driver's birthday. On their birthday, drivers are allowed an additional tolerance of 5 units of speed, which affects the type of ticket they receive: no ticket, a small ticket, or a big ticket.
2. The "Birthday Speeding Policy" code implements a simple inventory management system, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete items in the inventory via a command-line interface. Users can manage the inventory by selecting different options, including adding new items and their quantities to the inventory, viewing all items and their quantities currently in the inventory, updating the quantity of a specific item, or removing a specific item from the inventory. The system provides a looped menu, enabling users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit the system.
